# PawsPlus+ PetFinder 

## Description

Created a pet finder application called PawsPlus+! With this application, persons seeking to adopt a pet are able to use PawsPlus+ to find dog and cat listings at animal shelters near them from the comfort of wherever they have internet access. Users are provided with some contact information to reach out about any pets they are interested in, as well as save their favorites for later viewing if they have yet to decide on their new pet.
